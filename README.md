# Materna Website Clone

during this project, I was challenged to design a clone of materna website.
in this challenge I was tasked to only design only the homepage of the original website and luckily I tried  to clone the design.

this homepage seems easy but it is very challenging and ofcourse I learned a lot of things while designing it.

## Tech stachs that I used:

during the design of this website clone I used:
- <b>HTML</b> as a markup language that designs pages
- <b>Tailwind CSS</b> -> a CSS framework that helps you to style HTML pages more efficiently.

## Methods used:

this webpage includes almost every method someone can use wen designing a website, so me too I didn't go far.
I used the following approaches:
<ul>
<b>Grid</b>
<b>Flexbox</b>
<b>positioning</b>
</ul>

## links:
